# AI-Text-Detector

## Description
This project develops an AI Text Detector that identifies whether a given piece of text was generated by an artificial intelligence model. With the rise of AI-generated content, distinguishing between human-written and machine-produced text has become increasingly challenging. By utilizing machine learning algorithms, the tool analyzes linguistic patterns and other unique features to differentiate between human and AI-generated content. It is designed to verify content authenticity, detect potential plagiarism, and assess the originality of text across various fields such as academia, journalism, and content creation. The primary goal is to provide an accurate and efficient solution for detecting AI-generated text.

## Problem Statemtent
The problem is to develop an accurate AI Text Detector that can distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text to ensure content authenticity and originality.

## About Data Set
I used two datasets and combined them to create a larger dataset.
1. The dataset is in CSV format.
2. It contains two columns: text and generated (output or class label).
3. The dataset consists of a total of 1.22 million rows.
4. Each row represents a text and its corresponding class label (1 - Human Text and 0 - AI Generated text).

## Machine Learning Problem
• It is a Binary Class Classification problem.

• For a given text sample, the model will classify it as either:

• Class 1: Human-written: The text was written by a human.

• Class 0: AI-generated:The text was generated by an AI model. 

## Performance metric
• Accuracy : Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions (both positive and negative) out of all predictions made by the model. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best score and 0 the worst.

• Accuracy = (Total Number of Predictions) / (Number of Correct Predictions) = (TP+TN+FP+FN) / (TP+TN)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### Load Data
• Using Pandas to load the CSV file into a DataFrame.
### Checking for duplicates and missing values
• There are 52,015 duplicates rows in the dataset.

• There are no NULL values in the dataset.

### Class Distribution

• Class 1 (Human-written): 601,819 samples

• Class 0 (AI-generated): 622,323 samples

• Since the dataset is fairly balanced with a similar number of samples in each class, accuracy is an appropriate evaluation metric for this binary classification problem.

## Data cleaning and preprocessing
• Remove Spcial characters.

• Remove stop words.

• Remove HTML Tags.

• Convert to lower case.

• Use SnowballStemmer to stem the words.

• Converting Text to Vector Using TF-IDF Vectorizer.

## Training Machine Learning Model
### Train Test Split
• Splitting 80% data into train and 20% data into test using random split.

### Logistic Regression
• Accuracy - 0.9163 ~ 91.63%
### Linear SVM
• Accuracy - 0.9162 ~ 91.62%
### Multinomial Naive Bayes
• Accuracy - 0.8158 ~ 81.58%
